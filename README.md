# SinCosPlot
Minimal Arduino Uno project that prints a sine/cosine wave to the serial port, which can then be visualized in any plotting program (e.g. the Arduino IDE Serial Plotter).

This project uses the Visual Studio Code plugin [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), which is far superior to the ArduinoIDE for working with common microcontrollers, at least in my opinion.
